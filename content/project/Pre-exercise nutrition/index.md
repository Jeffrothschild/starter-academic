**What should I eat before training?**

To study what cyclists should eat before interval training sessions, and how it affects their training adaptations, we are looking for cyclists to participate in a study at AUT Millennium on Auckland's north shore!

There is surprisingly little research in trained cyclists looking at things like fed vs. fasted training and how that affects your training adaptations.

During the 3-week block of high-intensity training, you will be randomly assigned to one of three pre-exercise nutrition groups - a carbohydrate-rich breakfast (e.g. bread, jam, and sports drink), a protein-rich breakfast (e.g. protein powder and peanut butter), or training in the overnight-fasted state. This will be consumed before each of the in-lab interval training sessions.

**The study is six weeks in total, which includes 16 visits to AUT Millennium.**

**Week 1 (pre-testing)**: Two visits (VO2max test and time-trial)<br>
**Week 2 (pre-testing)**: Two visits (Muscle biopsy and time-trial)<br>
**Weeks 3-5 (training block)**: Three interval training sessions per week for three weeks<br>
**Week 6 (post-testing)**: Three visits (VO2max test, muscle biopsy, and time-trial)<br>

All food eaten prior to exercise sessions will be provided for the entire study period.

You will also have three prescribed low-intensity training sessions per week, which you can do on your own (and send me the .fit file) or in the lab. Before these sessions you will be given a standardized breakfast to consume. 

This way, we can isolate the effects of the various pre-exercise nutrition choices on interval training, but in the context of a real-world training plan that includes both high and low-intensity training.

Beyond the prescribed sessions, we also allow up to four additional hours of low-intensity training per week (these can also be runs or swims).

I appreciate that this study will require a big commitment and know that participants will get a lot from it. **The training program is designed to make you fitter over the 3-week period**, which will be measured pre- and post-training with VO2max (a measure of your overall aerobic capacity), 30-min time-trial power, and muscle biopsy (which will show us how things inside your muscle respond to the training). We are also interested in seeing how things like fat oxidation and your ventilatory thresholds are influenced by what you eat.

To be eligible youâ€™d need to be a male cyclist or triathlete, between 18-55 years old and currently training 8-12 hours per week (we do have two other studies currently going at AUT looking for women).
