abstract: "The objectives of this study were to determine pasting properties of non‐roasted (NR ) and roasted quinoa (RQ ) and to investigate the effect of RQ on consumer acceptance and physicochemical properties of an allergen‐free, gluten‐free cake formulation. Quinoa seeds were roasted at 177 °C for 15 (R15), 30 (R30) and 45 min (R45), and flours were analysed for pasting properties. Five cakes including a commercial chocolate cake (CCC ) and cakes made with NR and RQ flours were evaluated for preference by fifty panelists. Quality parameters included colour, water activity, moisture content, firmness, weight and height. Peak and final viscosity increased with roasting time. The NR cake had the highest sensory scores for appearance, colour and texture. On flavour and overall acceptability, CCC was the highest. Regarding quality data, CCC , NR and R15 cakes had similar L * values, while CCC had the lowest a *, b *, a w, moisture content and firmness values."
