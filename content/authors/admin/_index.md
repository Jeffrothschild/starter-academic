I am a Registered Dietitian (RD), Board-Certified Specialist in Sports Dietetics (CSSD), currently doing my PhD research at Auckland University of Technology in the Sports Performance Research Institute New Zealand (SPRINZ) research lab. Under the guidance of Dr. Dan Plews and Prof. Andrew Kilding, we are looking at the effects of pre-exercise nutrition on adaptations to endurance training. Essentially, trying to better understand how what we eat immediately before exercise (e.g. a carbohydrate-rich breakfast vs. a protein-rich breakfast vs. exercise in the overnight-fasted state) affects the responses to exercise training.

Before moving to Auckland, I worked as a sports dietitian in a private practice in Los Angeles. My clients include Olympians and professional tennis players, as well as competitive endurance athletes, and people trying to complete their first triathlon, feel better, and learn how they should be eating to achieve their goals. I have also taught college sports nutrition courses and spent five years as the assistant tennis coach at CSU Los Angeles.
