Endurance athletes of all levels face the same question â€“ what should I eat before exercise? 

A powerful interaction exists between dietary intake and exercise training. Accumulating research has shown that strategies which alter nutrient availability before and during endurance exercise can also impact training adaptations by enhancing or blunting the cellular responses to the exercise-induced perturbations. However, many questions related to best nutritional practices remain unanswered. The primary aim of this project is to better understand: 

*How do different pre-exercise nutrition strategies affect both acute and longer-term endurance training adaptations and performance?*

This project will use three distinct studies to obtain a more complete understanding of this question. The first study will be an acute crossover study, using a single session of steady-state exercise and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) performed in the overnight-fasted state or following either a carbohydrate-rich or protein-rich breakfast, to determine their effects on markers of metabolism and performance. Two training studies will then be performed, which will examine the effects of the same pre-exercise nutrition strategies on the physiological, metabolic, and performance adaptations to both HIIT and moderate-intensity continuous endurance training. Measurement techniques will include analysis of expired gas, lactate, urine, and muscle biopsy, as well as performance testing.

To our knowledge, no previous studies have compared fasted-state with carbohydrate-fed or protein-fed endurance training in trained athletes. In light of the large number of athletes who perform training in the overnight-fasted state, this research is important to gain a better understanding of the interplay between diet and exercise and has important and exciting implications for improving both athletic performance as well as public health. With more knowledge of how food intake can affect the response to exercise, athletes, coaches, and healthcare practitioners can better optimize the time spent exercising.
