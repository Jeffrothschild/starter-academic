The purpose of this study is to determine if the three-minute critical power test, which has been shown to produce valid and reliable estimates of critical power or the ‘anaerobic threshold’ for training intensity prescription in laboratory settings, is equally reliable when performed by athletes on their own in remote settings using an indoor trainer. We want to figure out if endurance coaches working with athletes remotely can consider asking their athletes to perform this test on their own in order to help guide training programmes.
