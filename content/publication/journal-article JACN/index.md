abstract: "Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the self-reported beliefs and practices relating to pre-exercise nutrition intake among endurance athletes of varying ages and competitive levels and examine differences based on sex, competitive level, and habitual dietary pattern.Method: An anonymous online survey was circulated internationally in English and completed by 1,950 athletes of varying competitive levels (51.0% female, mean age 40.9 years [range 18:78]). Survey questions included train- ing background, determinants of pre-exercise nutrition intake and composition, and timing relative to exercise.Results: Prior to morning exercise, 36.4%, 36.0%, and 27.6% of athletes consumed carbohydrate-containing food/drinks before almost every workout, some of the time, and never/rarely, respectively, with significant effects of sex (p < 0.001, Cramer’s V (φc) = 0.15) and competitive level (p < 0.001, φc = 0.09). Nutritional intake before exercise varied based on workout duration for 47.6% of ath- letes, with significant effects of sex (φc = 0.15) and habitual diet (φc = 0.19), and based on workout intensity for 39.1% of ath- letes, with significant effects of sex (φc = 0.13) and habitual diet (φc = 0.17, all p < 0.001). Additionally, 89.0% of athletes reported using at least some type of dietary supplement (including caffeine from coffee/tea) within 1 hour before exercise.Conclusions: Overall, nearly all factors measured relating to pre-exercise nutrition intake varied by sex, competitive level, habitual dietary pattern, and/or intensity/duration of the training session and suggest a large number of athletes may not be following current recommendations for optimizing endurance training adaptations."

summary: The aim of this study is twofold. The first aim is to determine the self-reported beliefs and practices relating to pre-exercise nutrition intake among endurance athletes of varying ages and competitive levels. The second objective is to determine whether differences in nutrition practices or beliefs rela‐ ted to sex, competitive level, or habitual dietary pattern exist.
