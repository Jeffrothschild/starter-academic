abstract: "There are a growing number of individuals diagnosed with food allergies and intolerances. Gluten, in particular, is avoided by many individuals because of celiac disease, gluten intolerance, and gluten ataxia. Individuals with allergies, intolerances, or both follow strict diets, but there is concern that these individuals may be at risk of several nutrient deficiencies, includ- ing decreased calcium, iron, B vitamins, and fiber. To prevent deficiencies, alternative sources of these nutrients must be provided. Gluten-free cereals and pseudocereals such as amaranth, buckwheat, corn, millet, rice, sorghum, and quinoa can be excellent sources of vitamins, minerals, fiber, and other important nutrients. Germination of these edible seeds has been shown to further increase nutrient content and to reduce antinutrients. Their use to naturally fortify and enrich gluten-free foods has great potential. Although there are many benefits to germinated seeds in food, more re- search must be done to improve texture and sensory properties to gain wider consumer acceptance. A review of germination of gluten-free cereals and pseudocereals and its effect on their nutritional profile is presented."

summary: The objective of this review was to include current research on the effect of germination on the changes in nutrients, phytonutri- ents, antinutrients, and bioactivity of edible seeds such as ama- ranth, buckwheat, corn, millet, quinoa, rice, and sorghum.
